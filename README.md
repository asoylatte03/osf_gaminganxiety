## Project Overview 
This project utilizes data collected from an online database from the Center for Open Science. Data is from an online survey of more than 13,000 gamers. The authors of the database surveyed participants' demographics (e.g., Gender, Age), gaming habits (e.g., game most frequently played, hours played, platform used), and used a variety of psychometric scales (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), etc.)

More information on the dataset can be found online at the [Center for Open Science database](https://osf.io/vnbxk/) as well as a copy of the survey used and detailed variable descriptions.
