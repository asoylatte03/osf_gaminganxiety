This project utilizes several key data science packages such as: 
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

In addition, this project relies on additional libraries for data visualizations and modeling such as `plot-likert` and `xgboost`
```

```
```
conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost
```

## Project Overview

## Data
This project utilizes data collected from an online database from the Center for Open Science. Data is from an online survey of more than 13,000 gamers. The authors of the database surveyed participants' demographics (e.g., Gender, Age), gaming habits (e.g., game most frequently played, hours played, platform used), and used a variety of psychometric scales (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), etc.)

More information on the dataset can be found online at the [Center for Open Science database](https://osf.io/vnbxk/) as well as a copy of the survey used and detailed variable descriptions.

## Key Recommendations & Actions 
### GADE 
GADE’ was an optional item assessing how difficult anxious behavior patterns affected work, self-regulation, and interpersonal relationships

Focus on understanding how anxious attitudes affect different aspects of a child’s life (e.g., professional settings, interpersonal or familial relationships) 
Parents working with children to develop sustainable routines adapted around gaming habits 
### Motivation for Playing 
Focus on understanding a child’s motivation for gaming(e.g., winning) and how it relates to patterns of anxious behaviors 
Parents communicating with their children about motivations behind gaming; compassionate relationships
### Hours Played 
Monitor hours played per week and how it relates to patterns of anxious behaviors
Parents setting boundaries and limits on hours spent gaming; modeling healthy patterns of tech use
